# Director User Specification Guidelines:

Directors will be required to create a director account which will include information about their name, midd and personal emails, and class year.  They can add a bio at account creation or at a later time.

When a film is being submitted, all directors must already have a registered account.  The film adder will click buttons (name and class year) representing the directors to select all directors who worked on the film.

On account create director pages will be assigned to them (with a generated unique link (/classYear/name?)).  These pages will hold the name and films assigned to the director.  When a director adds a bio it will show up here, along with the ability to add contact information if wanted (we will need a boolean toggle for this).
